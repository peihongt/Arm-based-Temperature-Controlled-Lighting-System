# Introduction
In this project, we will be using STM32 Nucleo-64 development board to display different colour of lightning at the output RGB LEDs depending on the range of ambient temperature captured from the input temperature sensor. The details of the detected temperature value and the colour printing on the led will be printed on the output LCD screen.
